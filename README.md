WELCOME TO BATTLESHIP!

## Allen:
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

Iteration 3 was tricky because we were not able to write RSpec tests for a majority of the game class.  Instead we used a runner.rb file and SimpleCov to test program integration.  We wrote code in a linear fashion and then implemented the runner file, identified "bugs", then fixed the code accordingly.  

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

In order to complete iteration 4 we would have a major refactor.  For instance, we hard coded the number of ships by making them attributes in the game class, so the game will only be instantiated with a set number of ships.  Therefore their names could not be changed, sizes could not be changed, and number of ships was static.  Also, the board size was static.  We could have instantiated the board cells as a range and allowed the user to input the number of cells (last number in the range), and this could have been one possible solution.  Otherwise, we could have created options for "easy", "medium", and "hard" and hard coded ships in a similar way.  However the user would not experience as much flexibility. 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We experimented with VS Code Live Share and resorted to just sharing screens on Zoom.  We basically used the ping-pong method and took turns driving and navigating.  All of the code was done together and there was no individual time where we divided up tasks and items to work on.  In my opinion, based on my personal work style and personality, this would have been a much more productive option.  Overall it was a good experience and showed the importance of communicating individual needs for future projects.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Feedback was generally shared "on the fly" when it was appropriate.  The conversations were realistic and led to increased productivity overall.  We also utilized peer support and support from a mentor, as well as instructor check-in.
