# WELCOME TO BATTLESHIP!

This is the classic game "Battleship" built for the terminal using Ruby.  It uses plain old ruby objects with complex logic to emulate an AI opponent in a turn based console game.  

## Dependencies

`Ruby 3.2.2`

### How to Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine. You can download and install Ruby from [https://www.ruby-lang.org/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/garussell/battleship.git`

### How to Play

Follow these steps to play Battleship:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd battleship`.
3. Run the game using the command: `ruby runner.rb`.

The game will start, and you can enjoy playing Battleship against the AI opponent.

### Features

- **ASCII Art:** We've included captivating ASCII art to bring the Battleship experience to life.

### Future Iterations

While the current implementation serves as a solid foundation for the game, there are areas that could benefit from future improvements. For example, the `valid_placement?` method may need to be refactored to accommodate additional ships seamlessly.

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Conduct a significant refactor to enhance the scalability and maintainability of the codebase.
- Explore the possibility of introducing new features, game modes, or interactive elements.

Additionally, I am excited to recreate this project in Java to compare the two implementations. This comparative analysis will provide valuable insights into the strengths and differences between Ruby and Java, offering a unique perspective on the game development process.

This project stands as a testament to its humble beginnings during Turing School of Software and Design Mod1. As we look towards the future, these potential improvements will contribute to the growth and evolution of the Battleship game.
